# instaMouse
Like button for Instagram if you are using from PC

I'm a person who loves keybaords more than mouse ;)
So, while using Instagram on Laptop. It's bit difficulty to like others photo on Insta. 
To void these I made a small python script to Like(give heart) by clicking "h" button in keyboard. Also "p" for playing video 

Enjoy keyboarding :)

# How to use 

Install pyautoGUI, keyboard and time module:
`pip install PyAutoGUI`<br/>
`pip install keyboard`<br/>
`pip install times`<br/>
<h2> Then, run python script </h2>

``` 
git clone https://github.com/rafitc/instaMouse/ 
cd instaMouse 
python new.py
```
